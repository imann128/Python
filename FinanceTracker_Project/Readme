# Python Flask Application

This is a simple Python Flask application that demonstrates basic login functionality and serves a web interface for user interaction. Follow the steps below to set up, run, and use the application.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above installed on your system.
- A web browser to open and interact with the `index.html` file.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a New Python Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for the project.

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Requirements
Ensure your virtual environment is activated, then install the dependencies from the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, start the application using the following command:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### 4. Access the Application
1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. You can now proceed to use the application as desired.

### Sample Credentials
To simplify testing, two sample entries have been preloaded into the database:

- **Username:** `johndoe`  
  **Password:** `password123`

Feel free to log in with the provided credentials or create your own.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly using `pip list`.
2. Verify that your virtual environment is activated.
3. Check that `app.py` is running without errors.
4. Make sure your browser is opening the correct `index.html` file.

Enjoy using the application!
